            <p>
                I am a 30+ year old man with the soul of a child who wants to constantly explore, 
                try and learn something new. When I learn something, I try to learn it properly 
                and correctly. I am not afraid of mistakes and if I ever make one, I learn from 
                it and am wiser and better because of it. 
            </p>
        </div>
