            <p>
                I am a 30+ year old man with the soul of a child who wants to constantly explore, 
                try and learn something new. When I learn something, I try to learn it properly 
                and correctly. I am not afraid of mistakes and if I ever make one, I learn from 
                it and am wiser and better because of it. 
            </p>
        </div>

Hello and welcome! 
You may be asking, "Who is Peter?" Let me briefly share my story with you. At the age of 28, I realized that I wanted to be a part of something that was meaningful, that would help people live a simpler life, and that would be dynamic and bring me joy of the ride. So I decided to change my career, work on myself every day, learn to code and become a developer. After some time of searching, trying and failing, I found my style and completely focused on front-end development (HTML, CSS, JS, React.js, TypeScript etc).
I am currently a PRO student of @Scrimba. Here I'm going through a complete course for future front-end developers. 
I would like to find an entry-level job as a front-end developer where I could learn new technologies, methods, skills and diverse approaches to development. 
I know the road is long and challenging, but I am fully committed to making my dreams come true!
